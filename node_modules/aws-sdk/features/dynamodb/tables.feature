Feature: DynamoDB Tables

  Scenario: Item CRUD
    Given I have a table
    When I put the item:
    """
    {"id": {"S": "foo"}, "data": {"S": "bår"}}
    """
    Then the item with id "foo" should exist
    And it should have attribute "data" containing "bår"

  Scenario: UTF-8 support
    Given I try to delete an item with key "føø" from table "table"
    Then the error code should be "ResourceNotFoundException"

  Scenario: Improper table deletion
    Given I try to delete a table with an empty table parameter
    Then the error code should be "ValidationException"
    And the error message should be:
    """
    The paramater 'tableName' must be at least 3 characters long and at most 255 characters long
    """
    And the status code should be 400
